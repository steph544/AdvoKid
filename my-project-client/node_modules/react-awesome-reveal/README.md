[React Awesome Reveal](https://github.com/dennismorello/react-awesome-reveal) is a library for React apps written in TypeScript that adds reveal animations using the Intersection Observer API to detect when the elements appear in the viewport. Animations are internally provided by [Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) to benefit from hardware acceleration.

## Demo

You can find a demo website [here](https://react-awesome-reveal.morello.dev).

## Installation

To add this package as a dependency to your app, simply run

```sh
npm install react-awesome-reveal --save
```

or, if you are using Yarn (as I strongly suggest):

```sh
yarn add react-awesome-reveal
```

## Quick Start

Import effects from [React Awesome Reveal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-awesome-reveal) to your React component, for example the `Fade` effect:

```js
import { Fade } from 'react-awesome-reveal';
```

Then simply wrap the components you want to animate:

```jsx
<Fade>
  <p>I will gently appear as I enter the viewport</p>
</Fade>
```

## Supported Effects

The effects currently supported are `Bounce`, `Fade`, `Flash`, `Flip`, `HeadShake`, `HeartBeat`, `JackInTheBox`, `Jello`, `LightSpeed`, `Pulse`, `Rotate`, `RubberBand`, `Shake`, `Slide`, `Swing`, `Tada`, `Wobble` and `Zoom`.

You can pass the following properties to the animation components to customize the behavior:

| Prop          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Values                                                                                          | Default                                                               |

| `cascade`     | If set, each child of a reveal animation automatically get assigned a delay that takes into account their predecessor (child `i` enters the viewport after `i * delay * damping` milliseconds) ‚Äì useful for animating list items.                                                                                                    | `true` or `false`                                                                               | `false`                                                               |
| `damping`     | Factor that affects the delay that each animated component in a cascade animation will be assigned. If `damping = 1` then the delay will be equal to the animation duration; if `damping < 1` then the delay will be lower than the animation duration; if `damping > 1` then the delay will be greater than the animation duration. | `number` value                                                                                  | `0.5` (meaning that the delay will be half of the animation duration) |
| `direction`   | Origin of the animation (where applicable).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Usually `"top"`, `"left"`, `"bottom"` or `"right"`, with some exceptions documented in the code | `undefined`                                                           |
| `delay`       | Time to wait before the animation starts (in milliseconds).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `number` value                                                                                  | `0`                                                                   |
| `duration`    | The animation duration (milliseconds).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | `number` value                                                                                  | `1000`                                                                |
| `fraction`    | How much an element should be in viewport before the animation is triggered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | `number` between `0` and `1`                                                                    | `0`                                                                   |
| `triggerOnce` | Specifies if the animation should run only once or everytime an element enters/exits/re-enters the viewport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | `true` or `false`                                                                               | `false`                                                               |
| `reverse`     | Specifies if the animation should make the element(s) disappear. Set this to a state variable of your component to make the animation dynamic!                                                                                                                                                                                       | `true` or `false`                                                                               | `false`                                                               |
| `className`   | Class names to add to the wrapper element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | `string` value                                                                                  | `undefined`                                                           |
| `style`       | Object to add inline styles to the wrapper element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | `object` value                                                                                  | `undefined`                                                           |

### Example

To trigger the animation only the first time an element enters the viewport:

```jsx
<Slide triggerOnce>
  <p>I will animate only the first time you see me</p>
</Slide>
```

### Generic Animations

Starting from version `2.4.1`, you can use the default export to specify arbitrary animations through the `animation` prop:

```jsx
import Reveal from 'react-awesome-reveal';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <Reveal animation="fade">{/* Content here */}</Reveal>;
};
```

Note that the possible values for the `animation` prop are automatically suggested by your IDE if it supports TypeScript.

Of course, you can pass to it all the props described in the [Supported Effects](#supported-effects) section.

### Chaining Multiple Animations

To chain together multiple animations, set the `cascade` prop to `true`:

```jsx
<Fade cascade>
  <p>I enter first...</p>
  <p>...then comes my turn...</p>
  <p>...and finally you see me!</p>
</Fade>
```

This is _almost_ equivalent to

```jsx
<Fade>
  <p>I enter first...</p>
</Fade>
<Fade delay={1000}>
  <p>...then comes my turn...</p>
</Fade>
<Fade delay={2000}>
  <p>...and finally you see me!</p>
</Fade>
```

with the exception that, since each `Fade` component creates an isolated visibility context, in the second snippet every `p` will be shown only if they are inside the viewport (after the specified delay).

## Past Releases

### Version 1.x

Version 1.x required to manually include [Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) in your HTML file(s):

```html
<head>
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/3.7.2/animate.min.css"
  />
</head>
```

Moreover, the `duration` property was called `speed`.
